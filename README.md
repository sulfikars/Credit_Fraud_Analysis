# Credit_Fraud_Analysis
One of our clients, a credit lender in the USA, has shared some CSV files containing historical data as well as customer information with us. Our team is required to work on this data to extract some meaning full insights from the shared data so that the bank can understand further about the credit scores of their customers as well as the credit fraud being committed.
